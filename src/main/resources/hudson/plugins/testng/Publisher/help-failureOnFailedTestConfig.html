    <b>Mark as failure on Failed Test Configuration Methods</b>
    <p>Allows for a distinction between failing tests and failing configuration methods.
        Failing tests can be seen as an unstable build whereas failing configuration methods are a failed build.
        This will trump any settings in Thresholds section.</p>
